The code seems to work fine and I though your use of comments was helpful in 
understanding the code. Also the use of modularity by making the change grade a function
was great,however I think you defined it as changeStudentGrade() and called it as
just changeGrade(), so that could cause problems. Finally, I think a description of how
the input file containing the grades should be formatted would be helpful.
